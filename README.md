# BlueSky

BlueSky is a command-line patch tool for the SkyLight and HIToolbox frameworks. This tool is intended for non-Metal graphics cards running unsupported versions of macOS 10.14 Mojave and 10.15 Catalina. This tool fixes transparency issues by swapping UI materials in the SkyLight framework and setting the menubar and context menus to opaque in the HIToolbox framework. The HIToolbox framework patch is only supported on macOS 10.14 Mojave. The download size for the zip is around 100MB. If you download only the script then BlueSky will automatically download the full zip file that includes all the patched binaries. The original binaries are also included in the zip file and are used for the patch removing options. Backups are also made before and after patching in /Users/Shared. These backups can be restored manually but should only be used as a last resort. Please contact RMC if you need help in recovering a damaged system.
